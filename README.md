# Melbourne-Housing-Price-Prediction-with-Regularization
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Melbourne using linear regression with L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. The dataset contains various features related to properties such as the number of rooms, type, seller, suburb, land size, and distance from the city. The goal is to build models that can predict house prices and apply regularization to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

# Features:
- Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values by filling numerical columns with zeros or mean values.
Converted categorical variables into numerical form using One-Hot Encoding.
- Model Training:
Implemented Linear Regression to build the initial price prediction model.
Applied L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to the linear model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using training and test data to determine the predictive accuracy of each approach.
  
# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
